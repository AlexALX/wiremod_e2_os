This is an Wiremod Expression2 OS for Garry's Mod Game.  
Written in in-game Expression2 Language (wiremod addon).  
                                                                     
This is not an real OS, it cannot work anywhere except this game.  
Homever it works similar to a real PC (boot sequence etc), but still very much simplified.  

Main features:  
* PC BIOS, boot emulation.  
* Low-level File System what works with wire dupable HDDs.  
* 24bit BMP reader, draw on wire Digital Screen (up to 512x512).  
* Simple directory listing/file managing interface (DOS style).
