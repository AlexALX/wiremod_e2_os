This is an Wiremod Expression2 OS for Garry's Mod Game.  
Written in in-game Expression2 Language (wiremod addon).  
                                                                     
This is not an real OS, it cannot work anywhere except this game.  
However it works similar to a real PC (boot sequence etc), but still very much simplified.
